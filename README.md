### Awesome Bus

http://AwesomeB.us

Awesome Bus is my Dev Bootcamp final project. It's a mashup of Google Maps Routing information and live transit data for San Francisco. Put in a destination and it tells you when you need to leave to catch your bus. Built by myself, Julianne Beaudoin, Hannah Winter, and Julie Nisbet.

Nearly all of this project was written in JavaScript, and we learned more JavaScript in the 7 days building this project than any of us knew coming in.

Feel free to read through the code and comment, any feedback or criticism is very welcome.
