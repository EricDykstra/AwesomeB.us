1. User says "I want to go to there"
2. We do the normal GM routing with a NextBus Layer on top
3. Each of the relevant stops on the route will indicate the next live bus to arrive

ALGORITHM

1. Take user input

2a. Extract the LatLng of the bus stop and bus route
2b. Ask NextBus for all of the stops for the route


RULES
